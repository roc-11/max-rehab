4. As a new user, I want attractive and relevant visuals and colour schemes that work with the content.
5. As a new user, I want to be able to contact/book a physiotherapy session easily.

### Development-Planes

To create a comprehensive website that fulfills the above user stories and identifies the functionality of the site.

#### Strategy

Strategy incorporates user needs as well as service objectives. This website will focus on the following target audience:
* Roles: 
  * Current Users
  * New Users
* Demographic:
  * All ages
  * Residing in Ireland (mainly Cork)
  * New to physiotherapy/requiring physiotherapy treatment

The website needs to enable the user to:
* Find the desired information
  * what services the company offers
  * learn about the Max Rehab physiotherapists
  * what to expect at your first visit
  * how to contact the company (aquire more information or make a booking)
  * where to locate the physiotherapy clinic
  * connect on social media

#### Scope

The scope plane is about determining the requirements based on the goals established on the strategy plane.
* Content Requirements - the user will need to find the information defined above.
* Functionality Requirements - the user will need to be able to easily navigate the site to find the information they require and be able to contact the company for futher information/to make a booking.

#### Structure

The information was organised into a heirarchical tree structure (a site map) making clear how users would navigate the website with ease.

The site map can be found below:

<summary>Strategy Plane</summary>

</details>

#### Skeleton

The appearance of each page of the website was planned by making wireframes. It was essential to provide a positive user experience for the user. 

Initially, wireframes plans were hand-drawn on a notepad. More detailed wireframes were then created using a desktop version of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Link to Balsamiq homepage"). They can be found below:

<details>
<summary>Balsamiq Wireframes</summary>

![Site Wireframes](assets/readme-files/wireframe-all-pages.png)

</details>

### Design
#### Colour Scheme

The colourscheme was inspired by the theme 'Close to Nature' on [Visme.com](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/). The mix of earthy greens and blues was both visually appealing and intended to create a sense of stability, reliability and calmness for the user. 

As the wesbite development progressed, it was decided that the earthy greens would be the main colour, and instead combined with simple black and white. The website is for the medical field and the colour palette needed to be simple. 

All text is coloured either charcoal (#3a3a3a) or soft-white (#f7f9fb), depending on which background colour it needs to contrast with (essential for accessibility). A contrasting orange shade is used when hovered over text inputs on the contact form.

Details of the full colour palette can be found below:

<summary>Colour Palette</summary>

![Colour Palette](assets/readme-files/colour-palette.png)

</details>

#### Typography

The pairing chosen for the site are: 
* [Chivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chivo?preview.text=Max%20Rehab%20Physiotherapy&preview.text_type=custom)
* [Krub](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Krub)
* A backup of 'Lato' and sans-serif are applied in case of failure.

Chivo is used for title headings, while Krub is used for almost all other text. Both were imported from[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

#### Imagery

The imagery used on the site was sourced from various sites, mainly Pexels, Pixabay and Adobe Stock. All images have been compressed in order to speed up loading and processing times, particularly on mobile devices. The images chosen are in line with the theme of the site.

The main hero image (on homepage, about us and our services) is by ['Pololia'](https://stock.adobe.com/images/id/244750183?clickref=1011lwXM47CC&mv=affiliate&mv2=pz&as_camptype=&as_channel=affiliate&as_source=partnerize&as_campaign=wbm&asset_id=244750183) on Adobe Stock. The contact form background image is by artist [RDNE Stock project](https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-woman-getting-cupping-therapy-8313254/) on Pexels.

  ![Screenshot of the 500 page image](assets/readme-files/max-rehab-500.png)

### Features to Implement in the future

If the website were to be deployed in real-life, an online booking system would need to be part of the site's functionality. This was beyond the scope of this project, however, it would greatly add to the user experience of the Max Rehab site.

## Technologies Used

### Main Languages Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

  * GitHub was used to store the project after pushing
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ie/ "link to the adobe homepage")
  * Adobe Photoshop was used to resize images
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
  * Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design phase of the project.
* [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
  * 'Am I Responsive' was used to visualise responsive design throughout the process and to generate mockup imagery.
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
  * Google Maps was used to embed a map with Max Rehab's clinic location.
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
  * YouTube was used to embed a video on the website.
* [Looka](https://looka.com/)

## Testing

Testing information can be found in a separate testing [file](TESTING.md "Link to testing file")

## Responsiveness

Google Webdev tools were used throughout the project in order to ensure the site was responsive and user-friendly across a range of device and screen sizes.

The breakpoints used within the site are 1183px, 950px, 800px, 580px and 360px. 

In general, much of the site content is displayed in rows. For smaller devices, most of these rows are stacked for display on smaller device screens. The screen space is optimised for the user by doing this.

There were responsivity issues regarding the display of all pages on large device screens (over 1183px). It took some time to ensure that all information and images were centred on these large device screens, and to ensure the homepage information boxes had a max-width clause. In addition, on smaller screens there were problems with the height of each section. Becauce of clashing flexbox styles, some sections were overlapping and overflowing on small device screens. A style of height auto fixed this issue.

The website is full responsive and all functions are displayed correctly.

## Bugs/Known Issues

During initial testing, there were a few bugs discovered. After testing for various screen sized, there was a lot of work to do in oder to make the website responsive. The necessary changes were made an the website is now fully responsive. 

The reviews section was intended to be a slider effect. The homepage initially has a CSS slider of review images, coded using this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McPdzhLRzCg). The slider was not smooth and caused issues with the site scrollbar. Upon the advice of my mentor, I removed this an replaced it with a row of more visually appealing blockquotes. A JavaScript slider would have been more effective but this is beyond the scope of this project.

There are currently no known bugs/issues with the website.

## Deployment

This project was developed using [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/ "Link to CodeAnywhere site"), which was then committed and pushed to GitHub using the GitPod terminal.

### Deploying on GitHub Pages

In oder to deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
